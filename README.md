# Kidelyneen
A Qix inspired game in (compiled) Commodore BASIC V2.

The game actually relies on being compiled with MOSpeed to run properly: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2 

The build script expects MOSpeed's dist-directory to be in the current path. 
It will run in the interpreter as well, but very very (very) slowly.
